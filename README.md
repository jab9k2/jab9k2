My background is in Geophysical data processing and field data acquisitions. Currently my primary interests are in the
areas of python software development, scientific data exploration, and financial data analysis. At the present time
I'm working on getting certified as a data scientist and seeking employment in that area specifically. I am actively
seeking projects that will enhance my skills as a data processor and further my understand of how applications are
developed in general. If you have any interests in my projects here on github please feel free to shoot me an email
at jab39603@gmail.com.
